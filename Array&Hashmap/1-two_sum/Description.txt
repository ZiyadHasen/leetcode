this is the first leetcode problem and there are two approaches 


=>the first one is brute force which check every pair of inputs and return there index


=>the second is using hashmap and very clever :
    *:if the name hashmap called the first question is what are my keys and values are here 
    # here the keys are the num  and value its index got it? the how can i relate is  the next question
        * add every num and its index in hashmap then if compliment is in hashmap return the value of the compliment 
          and the current index 
          easy pieasy
