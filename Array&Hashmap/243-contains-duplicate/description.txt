=>set() 
Key features of set():

No duplicates: Each element is unique.
Unordered: The elements do not have a defined order.
Mutable: You can add or remove items after a set is created.

     if any(value > 1 for value in hash.values()):
     //////////////////////////////////////////////
     *: here we saw how Counter is very it converted the loop on the second part to one line
